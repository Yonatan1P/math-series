# Lab 02

Fibonacci Sequence: A function that takes in an integer n and returns the fibonacci sum for that index
    Tests written for Fibonacci Numbers 0-10, all tests passing
Lucas Sequence: Same function as the Fibonacci but starting with 2,1 rather than 0,1 as the first two values at indices 0,1
    Tests written for Lucas Numbers 0-10, all tests passing

These were all the requirements for this assignment, but the stretch goals were not completed
