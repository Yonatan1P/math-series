Fibonacci Sequence: A function that takes in an integer n and returns the fibonacci sum for that index
    Tests written for Fibonacci Numbers 0-10, all tests passing

Lucas Sequence: Same function as the Fibonacci but starting with 2,1 rather than 0,1 as the first two values at indices 0,1
    Tests written for Lucas Numbers 0-10, all tests passing

Sum Series Sequence: A combination of the two functions above that lets a user choose which sequence to use (Fib or Luc) based on a second optional parameter called "first"
    Tests written for both with no optional parameters, 1 optional parameter, and both optional parameters.
    Tests were also written for the first 2 numbers in each case, and for the 5 number in both series. 
These were all the requirements for this assignment, but the stretch goals were not completed
